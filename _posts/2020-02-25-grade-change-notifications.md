CanvasCBL will email you when your letter grades change.

You'll get, at **absolute maximum**, one email per class, per hour. That will
only happen if every single one of your teachers changes your grade every hour.

The Grade Change notifications are intended to be read at a glance.
The subject will say "Your grade changed in \<class name\>", and the
little email preview will say "It went from \<previous grade\> to \<current grade\>."

You can turn these notifcations on and off in CanvasCBL Settings, available
[here](https://go.canvascbl.com/settings).
