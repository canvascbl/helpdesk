d.tech's 2019-2020 semester 2 policy outlines dropping outcome scores.
Outcome scores are dropped-- up to one for every outcome-- when **all** of the following conditions are met:

- The assignment is due **on or before (date for 2020-21 year pending)**
- Dropping the score **improves** your final average

CanvasCBL follows this policy. Also, **when your score with and without dropping is identical, 
CanvasCBL chooses not to drop**.

## Examples

### 1 Outcome Score

Scores:

- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date

Average: `3.00`

This student's outcome average is 3 because they have one score.

### 2 Outcome Scores

Scores:

- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `4`, assignment due before the cutoff date

Average: `4.00`

This student's outcome average is 4, because their lowest score was dropped.

### Any number of identical scores

Scores:

- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `3`, assignment due after the cutoff date
- `3`, assignment due after the cutoff date
- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date

Average: `3.00`

This student's outcome average is 3, because all scores are identical.
CanvasCBL will show that the lowest score was not dropped.

### A variety of scores before the cutoff date

Scores:

- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `4`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `2`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `1`, assignment due before the cutoff date \[dropped\]
- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `4`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `2`, assignment due before the cutoff date

Average: `3`

This student's outcome average is 3, because the lowest score, 1, was dropped.

### A variety of scores before and after the cutoff date

- `2`, assignment due before the cutoff date \[dropped\]
- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `2`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `3`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `4`, assignment due before the cutoff date
- `1`, assignment due after the cutoff date
- `2`, assignment due after the cutoff date
- `4`, assignment due after the cutoff date

Average: `2.86`

This student's outcome average is 2.86, because their lowest *droppable* score has been
dropped. Note that the dropped score is 2 (not 1) because 2 is the lowest score that is
eligible to be dropped.
