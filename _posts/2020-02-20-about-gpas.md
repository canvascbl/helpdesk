Currently, CanvasCBL only provides **unweighted** GPAs for **the current semester**. The GPA is out of 4.

We do our absolute best to be as accurate as possible, but please contact your academic counselor for your guaranteed GPA.

## Report Card GPA

The “Report Card GPA” is the GPA you’ll see on your report card. 
d.tech treats grades with a + or a - as base grades (just letters, like A, B, or C).
This means that, if you got all B-’s or B+’s, your GPA would be a 3.0, as if you got all B’s.
Refer to the table for more info.

| Grade | GPA |
| ----- | --- |
| A | 4.0 |
| A- | 4.0 |
| B+ | 3.0 |
| B | 3.0 |
| B- | 3.0 |
| C | 2.0 |
| I | 0.0 |

## Traditional GPA

The traditional system treats grades with a + or a - differently than base grades (just letters, like A, B, or C).
You can use these, for example, to compare with friends at other schools.
These GPAs **do not appear on report cards or transcripts and are provided for reference only**.

| Grade | GPA |
| ----- | --- |
| A | 4.0 |
| A- | 3.7 |
| B+ | 3.3 |
| B | 3.0 |
| B- | 2.7 |
| C | 2.0 |
| I | 0.0 |
