It is here for reference only.\n\nCanvasCBL offers the most comprehensive set of tools to manage distance\nlearning.\n\nAvailable tools include:\n\n\n  Seeing your pass/incomplete grades\n  Breakdowns of your in-person courses\n  Mobile view for everything\n\n\nSee grades\n\nCanvasCBL offers three view options in our Mobile and Desktop view. The options\nare:\n\n\n  Show Pass/Incomplete Grades\n  Show Individual Course Grades (Traditional View)\n  Show Both\n\n\nShow Pass/Incomplete Grades\n\n\n\nPass/Incomplete grades will show up on your transcript.\n\nThese attempt to be the same grades that you\u2019ll see on said that transcript.\n\nShow Individual Course Grades (Traditional View)\n\n\n\nIndividual Course Grades is what CanvasCBL traditionally showed.\n\nIt shows the grade for each class. For the second semester of the 2019-2020\nschool year, those are not your final grades. They are combined to make a\nfinal pass/incomplete grade.\n\nA Course is Missing from Pass/Incomplete View!\n\nIf a course is missing, that means CanvasCBL wasn\u2019t able to match your courses.\nThis might be because you have nicknamed your courses in Canvas.\n\nThis video shows how to nickname\ncourses. If you did something like this, please remove the nickname and reload\nCanvasCBL.\n\nSomething Else Is Wrong\n\nSorry about that! We\u2019ve done our best to make Distance Learning grade\ncalculations as rock-solid as possible, but even we trip once in a while.\n\nPlease contact us with a description\nof your issue and we\u2019ll get back to you ASAP."},"using-20canvascbl-hiding-courses":{id:"using-20canvascbl-hiding-courses",title:"Hiding Courses",categories:"Using CanvasCBL",url:" /using%20canvascbl/hiding-courses/",content:"CanvasCBL can hide courses that you might not want to see in your CanvasCBL\ndashboard. For example, you could hide d.lab classes that may still have a\ngrade but aren\u2019t really relevant day-to-day.\n\nWhen you hide a course, it only disappears from CanvasCBL. It does not\nremove you from the class or hide it on Canvas.\n\nCanvasCBL also remembers courses that you hide across devices, so if you\nhide a class on your computer, it\u2019ll be hidden on your phone, too.\n\nHiding A Course\n\nTo hide a class, first, open the Course Settings menu by clicking on the +\nnext to a course\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nThen, just enable the toggle to hide the course.\n\n\n\nBam! The course is now gone from your dashboard on all your devices.\n\nUnhiding A Course\n\nWhen you unhide a course, it\u2019ll reappear in your CanvasCBL dashboard on\nall your devices.\n\nFirst, visit the CanvasCBL settings page.\nThen, enable Show Hidden Courses.\n\n\n\nNow, navigate back to the grades page. You\u2019ll see courses that were hidden\nhave a little eye next to them. This indicates that they\u2019re normally hidden.\n\n\n\nExpand the course by clicking on the + to the left of the course\u2019s name,\nthen you can disable hiding the course.\n\nRemember that CanvasCBL remembers which courses are hidden and shown on all\nyour devices\u2013 just reload CanvasCBL on other devices for changes to take\neffect."},"other-faq":{id:"other-faq",title:"FAQ",categories:"other",url:" /other/faq/",content:"This document has answers to our most frequently asked questions.\n\nWhat makes CanvasCBL different than the CBL Grade Dashboard?\n\nCanvasCBL makes it much easier to understand a path forward.\nSome notable features include:\n\n\n  Grade Breakdowns\n(see things like your lowest outcome, assignments and future assignments\nby outcome and way more!)\n  Grade Change Notifications\n(get a notification when your grades change)\n  Mobile support (CanvasCBL works on your phone\u2013 just visit\ncanvascbl.com from your phone!)\n\n\nCan CanvasCBL change my grades?\n\nNo.\n\nWhen you authenticate via Canvas, CanvasCBL gets a token that has\nthe permissions you do.
