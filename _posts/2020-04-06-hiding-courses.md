CanvasCBL can hide courses that you might not want to see in your CanvasCBL
dashboard. For example, you could hide d.lab classes that may still have a
grade but aren't really relevant day-to-day.

When you hide a course, it only disappears from CanvasCBL. It does not
remove you from the class or hide it on Canvas.

CanvasCBL also remembers courses that you hide across devices, so if you
hide a class on your computer, it'll be hidden on your phone, too.

## Hiding A Course

To hide a class, first, open the Course Settings menu by clicking on the +
next to a course's name.

Then, just enable the toggle to hide the course.

Bam! The course is now gone from your dashboard on all your devices.

## Unhiding A Course

When you unhide a course, it'll reappear in your CanvasCBL dashboard on
all your devices.

First, visit the [CanvasCBL settings page](https://go.canvascbl.com/settings).
Then, enable Show Hidden Courses.

Now, navigate back to the grades page. You'll see courses that were hidden
have a little eye next to them. This indicates that they're normally hidden.

Expand the course by clicking on the + to the left of the course's name,
then you can disable hiding the course.

Remember that CanvasCBL remembers which courses are hidden and shown on all
your devices-- just reload CanvasCBL on other devices for changes to take
effect.
