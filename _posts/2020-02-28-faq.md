This document has answers to our most frequently asked questions.

## What makes CanvasCBL different than the CBL Grade Dashboard?

CanvasCBL makes it much easier to understand a path forward.
Some notable features include:

- [Grade Breakdowns](/using-canvascbl/grade-breakdowns)
(see things like your lowest outcome, assignments and future assignments
by outcome and way more!)
- [Grade Change Notifications](/notifications/grade-change-notifications)
(get a notification when your grades change)
- Mobile support (CanvasCBL works on your phone-- just visit
[canvascbl.com](https://canvascbl.com) from your phone!)

## Can CanvasCBL change my grades?

**No.**

When you authenticate via Canvas, CanvasCBL gets a token that has
the permissions you do. So, CanvasCBL literally can not change grades.

## Can I pay CanvasCBL to give me better grades?

**No.**

See [this](#can-canvascbl-change-my-grades) answer for more information.

## Do you sell my grades?

**No.** We have never and will never.

## Do you ever share my grades?

Only with your permission.

CanvasCBL works with other apps (like Daniel Stoiber's
[Lab Lister](https://labs.ga)), and when they want your data (grades and more),
you'll see a prompt outlining exactly what they will have access to.
They're also never allowed to store grades. Learn more about other apps
and what they can do [here](https://go.canvascbl.com/dkagreement).

We can also use data like grades **without any personally identifiable information**
in **groups of 10 or more** for purposes like publishing semester reports and grade trends (soon!).
